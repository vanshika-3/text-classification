# Text-classification (movie reviews)
First Project
## Problem statement
By using text classification with Machine Learning by making changes in text vectorization using (BOW bag of words, N-grams and TFIDF) and changes in modelling (using algorithms Naïve Bayes and Random Forest) model’s accuracy is tested by taking data sets of positive and negative movie reviews.
### Data set for movie reviews

#### Conclusion
From the output, it can be seen that our model achieved an accuracy of 85.5%, which is very good.
